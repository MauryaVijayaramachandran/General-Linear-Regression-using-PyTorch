# General-MultiVariate-Linear-Regression-using-PyTorch

1. Linear Regression involves manipulating the bias and gradient to better predict the output. 
2. It is a supervised Learning Algorithm. 
3. We make use of the Yeild_data.csv file as our data set. 
4. This implementation is a 10 layer neural network with Relu activation and L1 loss used in consensus with the Adam optimizer.  
The goal is to predict the net_yeild given the temperature, humidity, rainfall data.
